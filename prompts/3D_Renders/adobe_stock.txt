Hello Mate,

Please act as an expert stock photo and vector keyworder with extensive knowledge of top stock marketplace requirements (Shutterstock, Freepik, Adobe Stock, Vecteezy).

For this task, I will provide you with two main pieces of information:

1.  **A list of {{END_FILE_NUMBER}} 'Graphics Generation Prompts' below.** Each of these prompts was used to create a unique graphical asset. You must consider each specific 'Graphics Generation Prompt' as the **primary source of truth for the subject matter, theme, and key visual elements** of its corresponding item.
2.  **The 'Master Metadata Prompt' (which follows this list).** This master prompt details the required CSV output structure, column specific rules (like character limits, keyword counts, forbidden terms), style guidelines, and specific platform requirements.

**Your overall task is to:**

*   Generate one complete row of metadata in the CSV for **each** of the {{END_FILE_NUMBER}} 'Graphics Generation Prompts' provided.
*   For each item:
    *   Analyze its unique 'Graphics Generation Prompts' to understand exactly what the graphic depicts.
    *   Then, meticulously apply all the rules, formatting, and guidelines from the subsequent 'Master Metadata Prompt' to create the `Document_Title_For_Exif`, `AdobeStock_Platform_Title`, `Long_Description_For_Exif`, `Keywords`, `Category`, and other necessary metadata fields for that *specific item*. The metadata must accurately and richly reflect the subject described in its individual graphics generation prompt, while adhering to all platform rules.

Please ensure you process each graphics generation prompt sequentially and generate a corresponding, compliant metadata set for each of the {{END_FILE_NUMBER}} items.

### Master Metadata Prompt: Adobe Stock Specific Instructions

Could you please generate Best SEO optimized metadata for these {{END_FILE_NUMBER}} items ({{START_FILE_NUMBER}}-{{END_FILE_NUMBER}}) and provide it as a CSV formatted string?

**The CSV string you output MUST contain the following columns, in the exact order listed.**
The first line of the CSV output MUST be the exact header row: "Internal Tracking Filename","Filename","Document_Title_For_Exif","AdobeStock_Platform_Title","Long_Description_For_Exif","Keywords","Category"
DO NOT include any conversational text, introductory phrases, markdown code block fences (```csv), or other formatting outside of the raw CSV string itself. The first character of your response MUST be a double quote ("), starting the CSV header.

**CRUCIAL CSV FIELD QUOTING RULES (FOR ALL DATA ROWS):**
*   **For simplicity and consistency, ALL data fields in the CSV output (except the header row) MUST be enclosed in double quotes (`"`).**
*   If a field's content itself contains a double quote, that double quote must be escaped by preceding it with another double quote (e.g., `""`).

1.  `Internal Tracking Filename` (Please use simple sequential filenames like `1`, `2`, etc., corresponding to the order of the Graphics Generation Prompts above.)
    *   *This column MUST be the first column in the CSV data you generate.*

2.  `Filename` (This should be generated by taking the **full, Adobe Stock compliant `AdobeStock_Platform_Title`** from point 4 and ensuring it is a valid base filename.)
    *   **Adobe Stock Specific:** Ensure this filename (excluding extension) is **70 characters or fewer**. It must exactly match the base name of the uploaded file. The correct file extension (.jpg, .png, .eps, .svg) will be added automatically by the tool based on your selection.

3.  `Document_Title_For_Exif`
    *   **Purpose:** This is for generic metadata display in file explorers (like Mac Finder's "Get Info" or Adobe Illustrator's "Document Title").
    *   **Generation:** A **very concise, short phrase (3-8 words)** that clearly states the subject. Use proper capitalization (Title Case).
    *   **Example:** "Isometric Hard Hat Render", "3D Construction Vest Icon"
    *   **Constraint:** DO NOT include punctuation other than periods if absolutely necessary. No commas.

4.  `AdobeStock_Platform_Title`
    *   **Purpose:** This is the main title field that Adobe Stock will extract from the embedded metadata of the JPG/PNG file. It corresponds to their "Title" field in their contributor portal.
    *   **Generation:** A concise and descriptive sentence (max 100-150 characters) that accurately describes the subject. Prioritize a clear description of the *subject matter*. The title should be an easy-to-read phrase.
    *   **Constraint:** DO NOT use commas in this title.

5.  `Long_Description_For_Exif`
    *   **Purpose:** This is for the longer, more detailed description field in metadata (like Adobe Illustrator's "Description" box).
    *   **Generation:** A detailed, accurate sentence or two (up to 150-200 characters) highlighting the style, use case, and key features.
    *   **Example:** "A high-resolution isometric 3D render of a hard hat. Features semi-matte surfaces and soft lighting, isolated on a white background."
    *   **Constraint:** **Crucially, avoid commas within the descriptive sentences for this field to prevent parsing issues in some metadata viewers.** Use periods to separate distinct sentences if needed.

6.  `Keywords` (Comma separated, relevant, and comprehensive.)
    *   **Adobe Stock Specific:** Provide 35 to 49 keywords. List them in **order of relevance**, as the **first 10 keywords are the most critical** for search.
    *   **Think deeply about how a professional designer or business owner would actively search for this specific icon.** Include not just direct terms but also synonyms, related concepts, and common use cases that a user might input into a search bar.
    *   Aim for 20-40 impactful keywords as you've noted.
    *   Prefer singular nouns (e.g., "hat" instead of "hats").
    *   Keywords should be objective and descriptive.
    *   Incorporate elements reflecting the style: "3D render, isometric, Octane render, photorealistic, semi-matte, soft lighting, drop shadow, layered depth, clean shapes, no outlines, naturalistic tones, isolated on white, premium icon, cohesive icon system."
    *   **CSV FORMATTING NOTE FOR 'Keywords': This field *inherently contains commas* as delimiters between individual keywords. Therefore, this entire field MUST be enclosed in double quotes (`"`) in the CSV output.**

7.  `Category` (Please select the single most appropriate category name for each Icon from the following list: Animals, Buildings and Architecture, Business, Drinks, The Environment, States of Mind, Food, Graphic Resources, Hobbies and Leisure, Industry, Landscapes, Lifestyle, People, Plants and Flowers, Culture and Religion, Science, Social Issues, Sports, Technology, Transport, Travel. For most of these 3D rendered Icons, 'Business', 'Graphic Resources', 'Industry', 'Technology', or 'Objects' will likely be the most appropriate.)
    *   **Adobe Stock Specific:** This is **highly recommended**. Your provided list aligns well with Adobe Stock's categories. The AI should select one.

8.  Please do not add any 'Intellectual Property' or 'Recognizable Brand name' in the metadata (neither `AdobeStock_Platform_Title` nor `Keywords`).
    *   **Adobe Stock Specific:** This is a strict requirement for commercial content.

**General CSV Integrity Note:**
*   Please ensure that each piece of data for an item resides entirely within its single, designated CSV column/cell for that row, correctly quoted as specified. Unintended column shifting due to problematic characters or incorrect quoting within a field must be avoided.

**Remember the Icons adhere to our style (this should inform all descriptive content for Adobe Stock columns `Document_Title_For_Exif`, `AdobeStock_Platform_Title`, `Long_Description_For_Exif`, and `Keywords`):**
"These items are high-resolution, isometric Octane 3D renders designed as premium icons for a cohesive system. They feature stylized naturalism, semi-matte surfaces, soft ambient lighting with gentle drop shadows, layered spatial depth, clean shapes with no outlines, naturalistic and distinct color palettes, and are isolated on a pure white background. These are not flat 2D vector graphics but rather 3D rendered illustrations."
