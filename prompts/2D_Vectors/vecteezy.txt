Hello Mate,

Please act as an expert stock photo and vector keyworder with extensive knowledge of top stock marketplace requirements (Shutterstock, Freepik, Adobe Stock, Vecteezy).

For this task, I will provide you with two main pieces of information:

1.  **A list of {{END_FILE_NUMBER}} 'Graphics Generation Prompts' below.** Each of these prompts was used to create a unique graphical asset. You must consider each specific 'Graphics Generation Prompt' as the **primary source of truth for the subject matter, theme, and key visual elements** of its corresponding item.
2.  **The 'Master Metadata Prompt' (which follows this list).** This master prompt details the required CSV output structure, column specific rules (like character limits, keyword counts, forbidden terms), style guidelines, and specific platform requirements.

**Your overall task is to:**

*   Generate one complete row of metadata in the CSV for **each** of the {{END_FILE_NUMBER}} 'Graphics Generation Prompts' provided.
*   For each item:
    *   Analyze its unique 'Graphics Generation Prompts' to understand exactly what the graphic depicts.
    *   Then, meticulously apply all the rules, formatting, and guidelines from the subsequent 'Master Metadata Prompt' to create the `Document_Title_For_Exif`, `Title`, `Description`, `Keywords`, and other necessary metadata fields for that *specific item*. The metadata must accurately and richly reflect the subject described in its individual graphics generation prompt, while adhering to all platform rules.

Please ensure you process each graphics generation prompt sequentially and generate a corresponding, compliant metadata set for each of the {{END_FILE_NUMBER}} items.

### Master Metadata Prompt: Vecteezy Specific Instructions

Could you please generate Best SEO optimized metadata for these {{END_FILE_NUMBER}} items ({{START_FILE_NUMBER}}-{{END_FILE_NUMBER}}) and provide it as a CSV formatted string?

**The CSV string you output MUST contain the following columns, in the exact order listed.**
The first line of the CSV output MUST be the exact header row: "Internal Tracking Filename","Filename","Document_Title_For_Exif","Title","Description","Keywords"
DO NOT include any conversational text, introductory phrases, markdown code block fences (```csv), or other formatting outside of the raw CSV string itself. The first character of your response MUST be a double quote ("), starting the CSV header.

**CRUCIAL CSV FIELD QUOTING RULES (FOR ALL DATA ROWS):**
*   **For simplicity and consistency, ALL data fields in the CSV output (except the header row) MUST be enclosed in double quotes (`"`).**
*   If a field's content itself contains a double quote, that double quote must be escaped by preceding it with another double quote (e.g., `""`).

1.  `Internal Tracking Filename` (Please use simple sequential filenames like `1`, `2`, etc., corresponding to the order of the Graphics Generation Prompts above.)
    *   *This column MUST be the first column in the CSV data you generate.*

2.  `Filename` (This should be generated by taking the **full, Vecteezy compliant Title** (from point 4) of each item and ensuring it is a valid base filename. **This field should be enclosed in double quotes in the CSV output as per the quoting rules above.**)

3.  `Document_Title_For_Exif`
    *   **Purpose:** This is for generic metadata display in file explorers (like Mac Finder's "Get Info" or Adobe Illustrator's "Document Title").
    *   **Generation:** A **very concise, short phrase (3-8 words)** that clearly states the subject. Use proper capitalization (Title Case).
    *   **Example:** "Monochrome Fog Symbol", "Abstract Graffiti Letters"
    *   **Constraint:** DO NOT include punctuation other than periods if absolutely necessary. No commas.

4.  `Title` (This is Vecteezy's main title field. Concise and descriptive, 5-8 words. First letter of significant words capitalized. **Crucially, do NOT include generic media type words like 'vector', 'Icon' (unless 'Icon' describes the subject, e.g., 'User Interface Icons'), 'graphic', 'illustration', etc., as a file type descriptor.** Avoid subjective adjectives like 'amazing' or 'best'. **This field should be enclosed in double quotes in the CSV output.**)

5.  `Description` (This is Vecteezy's main description field. A brief, accurate sentence or two highlighting style, use case, and key features. For example: "Set of minimalist business pictograms. Clean, two dimensional design, isolated on white background." **Avoid prohibited terms, subjective adjectives, and brand names.**
    *   **CSV CONTENT CAUTION FOR 'Description': To prevent CSV parsing errors where commas *within* a description sentence can cause the data to incorrectly split across multiple columns when the CSV file is opened in spreadsheet software (like Excel), please AVOID using commas *within* the descriptive sentences for this field. Instead, rephrase sentences to eliminate internal commas, or use periods to create shorter, separate sentences. The entire multi-sentence description for one item must still reside correctly within its single designated 'Description' CSV cell.**
    *   **This field should be enclosed in double quotes in the CSV output as per the quoting rules above.**)

6.  `Keywords` (Comma separated, 35-50 English keywords, aiming for 20-30 impactful keywords. List the most relevant first. **Do NOT include generic media type words, brand names, AI buzzwords, or repeat keywords.**
    *   **Think deeply about how a professional designer or business owner would actively search for this specific icon.** Include not just direct terms but also synonyms, related concepts, and common use cases that a user might input into a search bar.
    *   **CSV FORMATTING NOTE FOR 'Keywords': This field *inherently contains commas* as delimiters between individual keywords. Therefore, this entire field MUST be enclosed in double quotes (`"`) in the CSV output.**

**CRUCIAL VECTEEZY CONTENT RESTRICTIONS TO ADHERE TO FOR ALL METADATA FIELDS (for columns `Filename`, `Title`, `Keywords`, `Description`):**

*   **NO Generic Media Type Words:** Avoid **photo, video, vector, graphic, illustration, clipart, EPS, AI, SVG, PNG, JPG, etc.** in titles, keywords, and descriptions when referring to the file type. "Icons" is acceptable in a title if it describes the *subject matter* (e.g., "Weather Icons Set").
*   **NO Subjective or Opinionated Adjectives:** Words like **brilliant, amazing, best, awesome, incredible, beautiful, great, perfect** are not allowed.
*   **NO Brand Names or Trademarked Terms:** Do **not** use specific brand names/trademarks (e.g., “Nike,” “iPhone”). Use generic descriptors instead.
*   **NO AI Related Buzzwords:** Terms like **AI generated, machine learning, generative art, Midjourney, Dall-E, etc.**, are prohibited.
*   **Simple Punctuation Only (within field content):** Only periods (`.`), commas (`,`), dashes (`–`), and apostrophes (`'`) are allowed within the actual text of your titles, descriptions, etc. No emojis, multiple exclamation marks, or other excessive symbols. **(See specific CSV CONTENT caution for the 'Description' field regarding internal commas).**
*   **NO Spelling or Grammar Mistakes:** All metadata must be grammatically correct and free from spelling errors.
*   **NO Keyword Repetition:** Do not repeat the same word or phrase multiple times within the keywords list, or between the title, keywords, and description.
*   **NO Intellectual Property or Recognizable Brand Names.**

**General CSV Integrity Note:**
*   Please ensure that each piece of data for an item (e.g., its full Filename, its full Document_Title_For_Exif, its full Title, its full Description, its full list of Keywords) resides entirely within its single, designated CSV column/cell for that row, correctly quoted as specified. Unintended column shifting due to problematic characters or incorrect quoting within a field must be avoided.

**Remember the Icons adhere to our style (this should inform all descriptive content for Vecteezy columns `Document_Title_For_Exif`, `Title`, `Description`, and `Keywords`):**
"solid bold uniform stroke, monochrome, Icon like, centered, isolated on white, flat 2D vector, simple shapes, minimalist design for a consistent Icon pack."
